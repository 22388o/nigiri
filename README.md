Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vulpemventures/nigiri.git
```

Enter project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
nigiri $ bash scripts/install
```

Build binary (Mac version):
```
nigiri $ bash scripts/build darwin amd64
```

At the moment bitcoind, liquidd and electrs are started on *regtest* network.

Initialize nigiri:

```bash
nigiri/build $ nigiri-linux-amd64 init
```

Initialize nigiri configuation file at at path `~/.nigiri/nigiri.config.json`.

Create and run nigiri environment:

```bash
nigiri/build $ nigiri-linux-amd64 create
```

This will start 3 containers for `regtest` bitcoin network that run the following services respectevely:

* bitcoin daemon
* electrs REST server
* API passthrough with optional faucet and mining capabilities (nigiri-chopsticks)

After command has finished, nigiri start listening at `http://localhost:3000/`.

Start/Stop nigiri:

```bash
nigiri/build $ nigiri-linux-amd64 start|stop
```

Stop and delete nigiri environment:

```bash
nigiri/build $ nigiri-linux-amd64 delete
```

## Nutrition Facts

The [list](https://github.com/blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md) of all available endpoints can be extended with one more `POST /faucet` which expects a body `{ "address": <receiving_address> }` by enabling faucet.
